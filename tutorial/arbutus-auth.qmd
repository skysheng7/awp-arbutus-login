## Configure Credentials

   > ⚠️ **Security Warning:** DO NOT share your OpenStack RC File with anyone. Never push this to GitHub. This file is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

2. Source the OpenStack credentials script from your terminal:

```bash
source def-ubcawp-dev-openrc.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter your OpenStack password. Enter your password when prompted.

## Verification
